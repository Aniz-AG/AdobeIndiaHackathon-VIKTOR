# 📘 Adobe India Hackathon 2025

## ✨ Welcome to the “Connecting the Dots” Challenge

---

### 🔍 Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge.

Imagine this: every time you open a PDF, it doesn’t just passively display information — it speaks to you, highlights important ideas, draws intelligent connections, and becomes your research co-pilot.

That’s the future we’re building.  
That’s the vision behind **Connecting the Dots**.  
And we want **you** to shape it.

In this challenge, you’ll reimagine the humble PDF as a smart, interactive, AI-powered reading experience. One that *understands structure*, *connects concepts*, and *learns with you* — just like a human collaborator.

---

## 🗺️ The Journey Ahead

This challenge consists of **two exciting rounds**, each designed to test and showcase your ability to merge intelligence with innovation.

---

### 🔹 Round 1: **Build the Brain** 🧠

Your mission begins with raw PDFs — often dense and unstructured.

Your goal is to:
- 🔍 **Extract structured outlines** from unstructured PDFs with **blazing speed** and **high accuracy**.
- 🧩 Apply **on-device intelligence** to understand sections, recognize patterns, and **connect semantically related content** across documents.
- 🧠 Lay the groundwork for a **context-aware engine** that powers the future of digital reading.

This round is all about **core functionality**, clean architecture, and fast, scalable processing — think of it as building the PDF’s mind.

---

### 🔹 Round 2: **Design the Experience** 💡

Now it's time to bring your smart PDF engine to life!

In this round, you will:
- 🖥️ **Build a sleek, modern, intuitive web application** using **Adobe's PDF Embed API**.
- 📚 Integrate the intelligence from Round 1 to create **contextual navigation**, **smart linking**, and **interactive reading experiences**.
- 🎯 Focus on user experience — design an interface that feels **magical**, **natural**, and **delightfully intelligent**.

This is your chance to show off not just technical ability, but design thinking and storytelling through UI/UX.

## 🌍 Why This Challenge Matters

In today's world, we're drowning in documents. PDFs are everywhere — research papers, reports, notes, books, and more.

But the problem isn’t *access* to content — it’s *understanding* it.  
The winners in this digital age are the ones who offer **context, clarity, and insight**.

This challenge isn't just about building tools. It’s about:
- ⚙️ Rethinking how we interact with documents.
- 🔗 Connecting fragmented ideas into meaningful narratives.
- 📖 Creating a **new reading paradigm** for learners, researchers, and knowledge seekers.

Whether you're a:
- 👩‍💻 Machine learning engineer
- 🎨 UI/UX designer
- 📊 Data wrangler
- 🧙 Insight whisperer

This is your opportunity to **lead the evolution of knowledge interfaces**.
